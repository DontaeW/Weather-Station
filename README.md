The device developed is a weather station that was tasked with capturing and saving certain meteorological
data, such as â€œair temperature," "air pressure," "altitude," "humidity," "heat index," and "soil
moisture." This data is then available for display at the physical weather station and remotely
from any location through a web-based graphical user interface (GUI). All of these
functionalities are achieved through the use of an ESP32 microcontroller, an array of sensors to
acquire environmental variables, and a frontend and backend system to process, store, display,
and transmit this data.
